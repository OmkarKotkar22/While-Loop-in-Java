# 💻 Java Foundation: Control Flow & Iteration Programs

This repository is a collection of fundamental Java programs demonstrating two core programming concepts: **Decision Making Statements** (`if`, `else`, `switch`) and **Iteration** (`while` loops).

Each program is a practical example designed to solve a common problem, making it an excellent resource for learning basic algorithms and control flow in Java.

## 🚦 Decision Making Statements

This section focuses on using conditional logic to control the program's execution path.

### Key Concepts
* **`if-else if-else`:** Handling multi-way decisions.
* **`switch`:** Ideal for choice-based menus and constant value checks.
* **Logical Operators:** Using `&&`, `||`, and `!` for combined conditions.

### 1. Decision Checks and Comparisons
These files perform simple comparisons and classification:

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `DM_check_maxno.java` | Finds the maximum among three numbers. |
| `DM_check_twono_equal.java` | Checks if two numbers are equal. |
| `DM_check_even_odd.java` | Checks if a number is even or odd. |
| `DM_check_no_pos_neg_0.java` | Classifies a number as positive, negative, or zero. |
| `DM_check_vowel_consonant.java` | Checks if a character is a vowel or a consonant. |
| `DM_check_triangle_equi_iso_scalene.java` | Classifies a triangle based on its sides. |
| `DM_check_switch_leap_year.java` | Checks for a leap year using a `switch` statement. |

### 2. Calculations & Complex Logic
These files handle calculations based on conditional logic:

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `DM_cal_commission_on_sales.java` | Calculates commission based on sales amount tiers. |
| `DM_check_grade.java` | Determines a student's final letter grade. |
| `DM_check_stud_eligible_scholarship.java` | Checks if a student is eligible for a scholarship. |
| `DM_check_elec_bill.java` | Calculates the electricity bill based on consumption slabs. |
| `DM_calculator_use_switch.java` | Simple calculator using the `switch` statement for operations. |
| `DM_check_profit_loss.java` | Determines profit or loss from cost and selling price. |

### 3. Character Checks
| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `DM_check_alphabetic.java` | Checks if a character is an alphabet. |
| `DM_check_alpha_digit_specialchar.java` | Classifies input as alphabet, digit, or special character. |
| `DM_check_uppercase_lowercase.java` | Checks if a character is uppercase or lowercase. |

## 🔄 While Loop Programs

This section focuses on iterative programming, using the **`while` loop** to repeat a block of code until a specific condition is no longer true.

### Key Concepts
* **Indefinite Iteration:** Repeating a process where the number of iterations is unknown beforehand (e.g., when manipulating digits).
* **Modulus and Division:** Using `%` and `/` inside loops for digit-by-digit processing.
* **Series Generation:** Generating sequences of numbers.

### 1. Number Properties & Checks
These files implement algorithms to check for specific mathematical properties, often requiring a loop:

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `check_prime_no.java` | Checks if a single number is prime. |
| `primenum1_to_n.java` | Prints all prime numbers in a range (1 to N). |
| `check_perfect_no.java` | Checks for a Perfect number. |
| `check_neon_no.java` | Checks for a Neon number. |
| `check_happy_no.java` | Checks for a Happy number. |
| `harshadno1_to_n.java` | Checks and prints Harshad numbers in a range. |
| `no_palindrome.java` | Checks if a number is a palindrome. |
| `armstrongno1_to_n.java` | Checks and prints Armstrong numbers in a range. |
| `hcf_of_two_no.java` | Finds the Highest Common Factor (HCF) of two numbers. |

### 2. Digit Manipulation
| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `reverse_no.java` | Reverses the digits of a given number. |
| `sumof_digit_of_no.java` | Calculates the sum of all digits in a number. |
| `count_no_of_digit.java` | Counts the total number of digits. |
| `swap_first_last_digit.java` | Swaps the first and last digits of a number. |
| `first_last_digit.java` | Extracts and prints the first and last digits. |

### 3. Series & Sums
| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `sum_of_allNaturalno1_to_n.java` | Calculates the sum of all natural numbers up to 'N'. |
| `print_series_sq_1to10.java` | Prints the series of squares from 1 to 10. |
| `table_of_anyno.java` | Prints the multiplication table for a given number. |
| `alphabet_a_to_z.java` | Prints all alphabets from 'a' to 'z' using a loop. |
